# Heart-Failure-Classification

Objective:
Predict patient risk of dying from heart disease using various health parameters.

Process:
Data Preparation and EDA: Cleaned and explored data to understand distributions and relationships.
Model Training: Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used Grid Search CV to optimize model parameters.
Evaluation: Plotted ROC AUC Curve to assess model performance.
Interpretability: Analyzed feature importance and used interpretability techniques to explain model predictions.

Outcome: Effectively classified heart disease risk with enhanced model performance and clear interpretability insights.
